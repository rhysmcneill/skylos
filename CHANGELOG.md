## Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Added a Simplified Chinese README (`README_CN.md`)
- Added configurable web UI port support for `skylos run` via `--port` or `SKYLOS_PORT`

### Changed
- SKY-L030: Lint rule for `except Exception`/`except BaseException` with trivial handler (CWE-396)
- Continue CLI cleanup by extracting command boundaries, lazy-loading heavy analysis paths.Expanded regression guardrails around dispatch, output, and exit-code behavior

### Fixed
- Browser login callback now validates `state` and verifies the returned token metadata via `whoami`
- Fixed local web UI rendering to avoid unsafe HTML insertion patterns
- Sync credentials are written with stricter file and dir permissions

## [4.2.1] - 2026-04-03

### Changed
- `skylos agent scan` now defaults to the fast review path. Slow dead-code verification is opt-in via `--verify-dead-code`
- Agent review is more repo-aware, with better file selection and context for quality, security, and debt-style issues
- Added agent benchmarks and Codex comparison runs with token reporting

### Fixed
- Agent scans now fail cleanly on missing API keys instead of crashing
- Review output is clearer when dead-code verification is still running
- LLM provider and runtime settings now propagate correctly through the agent path

## [4.2.0] - 2026-03-30

### Added
- Added `skylos debt <path>` for technical debt hotspot analysis
- Added separate structural debt scoring and hotspot `priority_score`

### Changed
- Refactored the CLI entrypoint by extracting `baseline`, `badge`, `doctor`, `credits`, `init`, `whitelist`, `clean`, `whoami`, `login`, `sync`, `city`, `discover`, `defend`, `debt`, `ingest`, `provenance`, and `cicd` into dedicated command modules. 
- CLI refactor guardrails to catch dispatch, output, and exit-code regressions during future `cli.py` cleanup
- `skylos debt --top` now will override `report.top`
- Changed-file debt scans now resolve git diffs from the repository root and include `.js` / `.jsx`
- Debt baseline and history writes require project-root scans
- Debt baseline comparisons no longer count unseen hotspots as resolved
- Sync-installed pre-push hooks now run only the fast Rust/Python parity guard instead of a full `skylos .` scan, and checked-in Skylos hooks are limited to the `pre-commit` stage

### Fixed
- `skylos agent watch --learn` now forwards the learning flag into the watch loop

## [4.1.4] - 2026-03-25

### Fixed
- `skylos --llm` now shows populated `Problem:` descriptions for dead code findings instead of blank lines (fixes [#118](https://github.com/duriantaco/skylos/issues/118))
- Dead code findings in `--llm` output now include rule IDs (SKY-DC001–SKY-DC006) and proper severity levels
- `uvx skylos` crash on Windows due to litellm's `.pth` file exceeding MAX_PATH (260 chars) in uvx cache paths (fixes [#120](https://github.com/duriantaco/skylos/issues/120))
- Skylos now honors project `.gitignore` entries during file discovery, so ignored worktrees, custom virtualenvs, and other excluded paths are no longer scanned
- Flask, FastAPI, Starlette, and Sanic imperative route or lifecycle registration (`add_url_rule`, `add_api_route`, `add_route`, `register_listener`, `register_middleware`) is now treated as a live framework entrypoint instead of dead code
- Pytest and Pluggy hook implementations (`@pytest.hookimpl`, `@hookimpl`) are now treated as live plugin entrypoints instead of dead code
- Grep cache saves now fail open on non-writable roots instead of aborting analysis

### Changed
- `litellm` moved from required to optional dependency — install with `pip install skylos[llm]` for LLM features. Core static analysis no longer pulls in litellm.
- `litellm` version capped at `<1.82.8` to avoid known supply chain compromise
- Agent scans are faster on changed-file workflows, and fix generation is now opt-in
- Phase 2b LLM audits now focus on high-signal files instead of scanning the full Python set
- Static `grep_verify` now reuses `.skylos/cache/grep_results.json` across repeated local scans

## [4.1.3] - 2026-03-22

### Added
- Configurable duplicate string threshold — `duplicate_strings` in `[tool.skylos]` (default: 3)

- Added `django_filters` to framework detection

### Changed
- Quality table column renamed from "Function" to "Name"

- Post-scan hints replaced with context-aware nudges (1 per scan, based on results)
- Argparse epilog simplified — points to `skylos commands` and `skylos tour`
