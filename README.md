# What is Skylos?

Skylos is an open-source static analysis tool and PR gate for Python, TypeScript, and Go. It helps teams detect dead code, hardcoded secrets, exploitable flows, and AI-generated security regressions before they land in `main`.

If you use Vulture for dead code, Bandit for security checks, or Semgrep/CodeQL for CI enforcement, Skylos combines those workflows with framework-aware dead code detection and diff-aware regression detection for AI-assisted refactors.

The core use case is straightforward: run it locally, add it to CI, and gate pull requests on real findings with GitHub annotations and review comments. Advanced features like AI defense, remediation agents, VS Code, MCP, and cloud upload are available, but you do not need any of them to get value from Skylos.

### Best for

- Python teams that want dead code detection with fewer false positives than Vulture
- Repositories using Cursor, Copilot, Claude Code, or other AI coding assistants
- CI/CD pull request gates with GitHub annotations and review comments
- Python LLM applications that need OWASP LLM Top 10 checks

### Available as

- CLI for local scans and CI/CD workflows
- GitHub Action for pull request gating and annotations
- VS Code extension for in-editor findings and AI-assisted fixes
- MCP server for AI agents and coding assistants

### Start here

| Goal | Command | What you get |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Scan a repo** | `skylos . -a` | Dead code, risky flows, secrets, and code quality findings |
| **Gate pull requests** | `skylos cicd init` | A GitHub Actions workflow with a quality gate and inline annotations |
| **Audit an LLM app** | `skylos defend .` | Optional AI defense checks for Python LLM integrations |

### Why teams adopt it

1. **Better dead code signal on real frameworks:** Skylos understands FastAPI, Django, Flask, pytest, Next.js, React, and more, so dynamic code produces less noise.
2. **Diff-aware AI regression detection:** Skylos can catch removed auth decorators, CSRF, rate limiting, validation, logging, and other controls that disappear during AI-assisted refactors.
3. **One workflow instead of three tools:** Dead code, security scanning, and PR gating live in the same CLI and CI flow.
4. **Local-first by default:** You can keep scans on your machine and add optional AI or cloud features later if you need them.
5. **Self-explaining output:** Every table prints a legend explaining what each column and number means — no manual required.

### Why Skylos over Vulture for Python dead code detection?

| | Skylos | Vulture |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Recall** | **98.1%** (51/52) | 84.6% (44/52) |
| **False Positives** | **220** | 644 |
| **Framework-aware** (FastAPI, Django, pytest) | Yes | No |
| **Security scanning** (secrets, SQLi, SSRF) | Yes | No |
| **AI-powered analysis** | Yes | No |
| **CI/CD quality gates** | Yes | No |
| **TypeScript + Go support** | Yes | No |

> Benchmarked on 9 popular Python repos (350k+ combined stars) + TypeScript ([consola](https://github.com/unjs/consola)). Every finding manually verified. [Full case study →](#skylos-vs-vulture-benchmark)

### 🚀 **New to Skylos? Start with CI/CD Integration**

```bash
# Generate a GitHub Actions workflow in 30 seconds
skylos cicd init

# Commit and push to activate
git add .github/workflows/skylos.yml && git push
```

**What you get:**
- Automatic dead code detection on every PR
- Security vulnerability scanning (SQLi, secrets, dangerous patterns)
- Quality gate that fails builds on critical issues
- Inline PR review comments with file:line links
- GitHub Annotations visible in the "Files Changed" tab

**No configuration needed** - works out of the box with sensible defaults. See [CI/CD section](#cicd) for customization.

## Technical Debt Hotspots

Use `skylos debt <path>` to rank structural debt hotspots without collapsing everything into a single urgency number.

- `score` is the project-level structural debt score.
- `priority` is the hotspot triage score used for ordering fix candidates.
- `--changed` limits the visible hotspot list to changed files, but keeps the structural debt score anchored to the whole project.

```bash
# Full project debt scan
skylos debt .

# Review only changed hotspots without distorting the project score
skylos debt . --changed

# Compare the current project against a saved debt baseline
skylos debt . --baseline

# Save a repo-level debt baseline
skylos debt . --save-baseline
```

Debt policy files such as `skylos-debt.yaml` are discovered from the scan target upward, and explicit CLI flags like `--top` override policy defaults.

## Key Capabilities

The core product is dead code detection, security scanning, and PR gating. The AI-focused features below are optional layers on top of that baseline workflow.

### Security Scanning (SAST)
* **Taint Analysis:** Traces untrusted input from API endpoints to databases to prevent SQL Injection and XSS.
* **Secrets Detection:** Hunts down hardcoded API keys (AWS, Stripe, OpenAI) and private credentials before commit.
* **Vulnerability Checks:** Flags dangerous patterns like `eval()`, unsafe `pickle`, and weak cryptography.

### AI-Generated Code Guardrails

Skylos can also flag common AI-generated code mistakes. Every finding includes `vibe_category` and `ai_likelihood` (high/medium/low) metadata so you can filter them separately if you want.

* **Phantom Call Detection:** Catches calls to security functions (`sanitize_input`, `validate_token`, `check_permission`, etc.) that are never defined or imported — AI hallucinates these constantly. `hallucinated_reference, high`
* **Phantom Decorator Detection:** Catches security decorators (`@require_auth`, `@rate_limit`, `@authenticate`, etc.) that are never defined or imported. `hallucinated_reference, high`
* **Unfinished Generation:** Detects functions with only `pass`, `...`, or `raise NotImplementedError` — AI-generated stubs that silently do nothing in production. `incomplete_generation, medium`
* **Undefined Config:** Flags `os.getenv("ENABLE_X")` referencing feature flags that are never defined anywhere in the project. `ghost_config, medium`
* **Stale Mock Detection:** Catches `mock.patch("app.email.send_email")` where `send_email` no longer exists — AI renames functions but leaves tests pointing at the old name. `stale_reference, medium`
* **Security TODO Scanners:** Flags `# TODO: add auth` placeholders that AI left behind and nobody finished.
* **Disabled Security Controls:** Detects `verify=False`, `@csrf_exempt`, `DEBUG=True`, and `ALLOWED_HOSTS=["*"]`.
* **Credential & Randomness Checks:** Catches hardcoded passwords and `random.choice()` used for security-sensitive values like tokens and OTPs.

### Prompt Injection and Content Scanning

These checks run under `--danger` and look for prompt injection patterns or obfuscated instructions in repository content.

* **Multi-File Prompt Injection Scanner:** Scans Python, Markdown, YAML, JSON, TOML, and `.env` files for hidden instruction payloads — instruction overrides ("ignore previous instructions"), role hijacking ("you are now"), AI-targeted suppression ("do not flag", "skip security"), data exfiltration prompts, and AI-targeting phrases.
* **Text Canonicalization Engine:** NFKC normalization, whitespace folding, and confusable replacement neutralize obfuscation before pattern matching.
* **Zero-Width & Invisible Unicode:** Detects zero-width spaces, joiners, BOM, and bidi overrides (U+200B–U+202E) that hide payloads from human reviewers.
* **Base64 Obfuscation Detection:** Automatically decodes base64-encoded strings and re-scans for injection content.
* **Homoglyph / Mixed-Script Detection:** Flags Cyrillic and Greek characters mixed with Latin text (e.g., Cyrillic 'а' in `password`) that bypass visual review.
* **Location-Aware Severity:** Findings in README files, HTML comments, and YAML prompt fields get elevated severity. Test files are automatically skipped.

### Advanced: AI Defense for LLM Apps

Static analysis for AI application security that maps every LLM call in your Python codebase and checks for missing guardrails. **Python only** (TypeScript/Go support planned).

```bash
# Discover all LLM integrations
skylos discover .

# Check defenses and get a scored report
skylos defend .

# CI gate: fail on critical gaps, require 70% defense score
skylos defend . --fail-on critical --min-score 70

# JSON output for dashboards and pipelines
skylos defend . --json -o defense-report.json

# Filter by OWASP LLM Top 10 category
skylos defend . --owasp LLM01,LLM04
```

**13 checks across defense and ops:**

| Check | Severity | OWASP | What it detects |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| `no-dangerous-sink` | Critical | LLM02 | LLM output flowing to eval/exec/subprocess |
| `untrusted-input-to-prompt` | Critical | LLM01 | Raw user input in prompt with no processing |
| `tool-scope` | Critical | LLM04 | Agent tools with dangerous system calls |
| `tool-schema-present` | Critical | LLM04 | Agent tools without typed schemas |
| `output-validation` | High | LLM02 | LLM output used without structured validation |
| `prompt-delimiter` | High | LLM01 | User input in prompts without delimiters |
| `rag-context-isolation` | High | LLM01 | RAG context injected without isolation |
| `output-pii-filter` | High | LLM06 | No PII filtering on user-facing LLM output |
| `model-pinned` | Medium | LLM03 | Model version not pinned (floating alias) |
| `input-length-limit` | Low | LLM01 | No input length check before LLM call |
| `logging-present` | Medium | Ops | No logging around LLM calls |
| `cost-controls` | Medium | Ops | No max_tokens set on LLM calls |
| `rate-limiting` | Medium | Ops | No rate limiting on LLM endpoints |

**Defense and ops scores are tracked separately** — adding logging won't inflate your security score.

**Custom policy** via `skylos-defend.yaml`:
```yaml
rules:
  model-pinned:
    severity: critical    # Upgrade severity
  input-length-limit:
    enabled: false        # Disable check
gate:
  min_score: 70
  fail_on: high
```

Supports OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, Cohere, Mistral, Ollama, Together AI, Groq, Fireworks, Replicate, LiteLLM, LangChain, LlamaIndex, CrewAI, and AutoGen.

### Dead Code Detection & Cleanup
* **Find Unused Code:** Identifies unreachable functions, orphan classes, and unused imports with confidence scoring.
* **Smart Tracing:** Distinguishes between truly dead code and dynamic frameworks (Flask/Django routes, Pytest fixtures).
* **Safe Pruning:** Uses LibCST to safely remove dead code without breaking syntax.

### Advanced: Agents, Reviews, and Remediation
* **Context-aware audits:** Combines static analysis speed with LLM reasoning to validate findings and filter noise.
* **Remediation workflow:** `skylos agent remediate` can scan, generate fixes, run tests, and optionally open a PR.
* **Local model support:** Supports Ollama and other OpenAI-compatible local endpoints if you want code to stay on your machine.

### CI/CD and PR Gating

* **30-Second Workflow Setup:** `skylos cicd init` generates GitHub Actions workflows with sensible defaults.
* **Diff-Aware Enforcement:** Gate only the lines that changed, fail on severity thresholds, and keep legacy debt manageable with baselines.
* **PR-Native Feedback:** GitHub annotations, inline review comments, and optional dashboard upload keep findings where teams already work.
* **Corpus Guard:** Require the `Corpus Guard` workflow on PRs to catch dead-code precision regressions against curated framework and language fixtures.

### Safe Cleanup and Workflow Controls

* **CST-safe removals:** Uses LibCST to remove selected imports or functions (handles multiline imports, aliases, decorators, async etc..)
* **Logic Awareness**: Deep integration for Python frameworks (Django, Flask, FastAPI) and TypeScript (Tree-sitter) to identify active routes and dependencies.
* **Granular Filtering**: Skip lines tagged with `# pragma: no skylos`, `# pragma: no cover`, or `# noqa`

### Operational Governance & Runtime

* **Coverage Integration**: Auto-detects `.skylos-trace` files to verify dead code with runtime data
* **Quality Gates**: Enforces hard thresholds for complexity, nesting, and security risk via `pyproject.toml` to block non-compliant PRs
* **Interactive CLI**: Manually verify and remove/comment-out findings through an `inquirer`-based terminal interface
* **Security-Audit Mode**: Leverages an independent reasoning loop to identify security vulnerabilities

### Pytest Hygiene

* **Unused Fixture Detection**: Finds unused `@pytest.fixture` definitions in `test_*.py` and `conftest.py`
* **Cross-file Resolution**: Tracks fixtures used across modules, not just within the same file

### Multi-Language Support

| Language | Parser | Dead Code | Security | Quality |
|----------|--------|-----------|----------|---------|
| Python | AST | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| TypeScript/TSX | Tree-sitter | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Java | Tree-sitter | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Go | Standalone binary | ✅ | - | - |

Languages are auto-detected by file extension. Mixed-language repos work out of the box. No Node.js or JDK required — all parsers are built-in via Tree-sitter.

#### TypeScript Rules

| Rule | ID | What It Catches |
|------|-----|-----------------|
| **Dead Code** | | |
| Functions | - | Unused functions, arrow functions, and overloads |
| Classes | - | Unused classes, interfaces, enums, and type aliases |
| Imports | - | Unused named, default, and namespace imports |
| Methods | - | Unused methods (lifecycle methods excluded) |
| **Security** | | |
| eval() | SKY-D201 | `eval()` usage |
| Dynamic exec | SKY-D202 | `exec()`, `new Function()`, `setTimeout` with string |

| Insecure random | SKY-D250 | `Math.random()` for security-sensitive ops |
| Sensitive logs | SKY-D251 | Passwords/tokens passed to `console.log()` |
| Insecure cookie | SKY-D252 | Missing `httpOnly`/`secure` flags |
| Timing attack | SKY-D253 | `===`/`==` comparison of secrets |
| Storage tokens | SKY-D270 | Sensitive data in `localStorage`/`sessionStorage` |

| Await in loop | SKY-Q402 | `await` inside for/while loop |
| Unreachable code | SKY-UC002 | Code after return/throw/break/continue |

**Framework-aware:** Next.js convention exports (`page.tsx`, `layout.tsx`, `route.ts`, `middleware.ts`), config exports (`getServerSideProps`, `generateMetadata`, `revalidate`), React patterns (`memo`, `forwardRef`), and exported custom hooks (`use*`) are automatically excluded from dead code reports.

TypeScript dead code detection tracks: callbacks, type annotations, generics, decorators, inheritance (`extends`), object shorthand, spread, re-exports, and `typeof` references. Benchmarked at 95% recall with 0 false positives on alive code.

## Installation

### Basic Installation

```bash
## from pypi
pip install skylos

## with LLM-powered features (agent verify, agent remediate, etc.)
pip install skylos[llm]

## with Rust-accelerated analysis (up to 63x faster)
pip install skylos[fast]

## both
pip install skylos[llm,fast]

## or from source
git clone https://github.com/duriantaco/skylos.git
cd skylos

pip install .
```

> **`skylos[fast]`** installs an optional Rust backend that accelerates clone detection (63x), file discovery (5x), coupling analysis, and cycle detection. Same results, just faster. Pure Python works fine without it — the Rust module is auto-detected at runtime.
>
> **`skylos[llm]`** installs `litellm` for LLM-powered features (`skylos agent verify`, `skylos agent remediate`, `--llm`). Core static analysis works without it.

### 🎯 What's Next?

After installation, we recommend:

1. **Set up CI/CD (30 seconds):**
   ```bash
   skylos cicd init
   git add .github/workflows/skylos.yml && git push
   ```
   This will automatically scan every PR for dead code and security issues.

2. **Run your first scan:**
   ```bash
   skylos .                              # Dead code only
   skylos . --danger --secrets           # Include security checks
   ```

3. **Keep scans focused on active work:**
   ```bash
   skylos . --diff origin/main
   ```

4. **Try advanced workflows only if you need them:**
   ```bash
   skylos agent review . --model gpt-4.1
   skylos defend .
   ```

## Skylos vs. Vulture Benchmark

We benchmarked Skylos against Vulture on **9 of the most popular Python repositories on GitHub** — 350k+ combined stars, covering HTTP clients, web frameworks, CLI tools, data validation, terminal UIs, and progress bars. Every single finding was **manually verified** against the source code. No automated labelling, no cherry-picking.

### Why These 9 Repos?

We deliberately chose projects that stress-test dead code detection in different ways:

| Repository | Stars | What It Tests |
|:---|---:|:---|
| [psf/requests](https://github.com/psf/requests) | 53k | `__init__.py` re-exports, Sphinx conf, pytest classes |
| [pallets/click](https://github.com/pallets/click) | 17k | IO protocol methods (`io.RawIOBase` subclasses), nonlocal closures |
| [encode/starlette](https://github.com/encode/starlette) | 10k | ASGI interface params, polymorphic dispatch, public API methods |
| [Textualize/rich](https://github.com/Textualize/rich) | 51k | `__rich_console__` protocol, sentinel vars via `f_locals`, metaclasses |
| [encode/httpx](https://github.com/encode/httpx) | 14k | Transport/auth protocol methods, zero dead code (pure FP test) |
| [pallets/flask](https://github.com/pallets/flask) | 69k | Jinja2 template globals, Werkzeug protocol methods, extension hooks |
| [pydantic/pydantic](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic) | 23k | Mypy plugin hooks, hypothesis `@resolves`, `__getattr__` config |
| [fastapi/fastapi](https://github.com/fastapi/fastapi) | 82k | 100+ OpenAPI spec model fields, Starlette base class overrides |
| [tqdm/tqdm](https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm) | 30k | Keras/Dask callbacks, Rich column rendering, pandas monkey-patching |

No repo was excluded for having unfavorable results. We include repos where Vulture beats Skylos (click, starlette, tqdm).

### Results

| Repository | Dead Items | Skylos TP | Skylos FP | Vulture TP | Vulture FP |
|:---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| psf/requests | 6 | 6 | 35 | 6 | 58 |
| pallets/click | 7 | 7 | 8 | 6 | 6 |
| encode/starlette | 1 | 1 | 4 | 1 | 2 |
| Textualize/rich | 13 | 13 | 14 | 10 | 8 |
| encode/httpx | 0 | 0 | 6 | 0 | 59 |
| pallets/flask | 7 | 7 | 12 | 6 | 260 |
| pydantic/pydantic | 11 | 11 | 93 | 10 | 112 |
| fastapi/fastapi | 6 | 6 | 30 | 4 | 102 |
| tqdm/tqdm | 1 | 0 | 18 | 1 | 37 |
| **Total** | **52** | **51** | **220** | **44** | **644** |

| Metric | Skylos | Vulture |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Recall** | **98.1%** (51/52) | 84.6% (44/52) |
| **False Positives** | **220** | 644 |
| **Dead items found** | **51** | 44 |

Skylos finds **7 more dead items** than Vulture with **3x fewer false positives**.

### Why Skylos Produces Fewer False Positives

Vulture uses flat name matching — if the bare name `X` appears anywhere as a string or identifier, all definitions named `X` are considered used. This works well for simple cases but drowns in noise on framework-heavy codebases:

- **Flask** (260 Vulture FP): Vulture flags every Jinja2 template global, Werkzeug protocol method, and Flask extension hook. Skylos recognizes Flask/Werkzeug patterns.
- **Pydantic** (112 Vulture FP): Vulture flags all config class annotations, `TYPE_CHECKING` imports, and mypy plugin hooks. Skylos understands Pydantic model fields and `__getattr__` dynamic access.
- **FastAPI** (102 Vulture FP): Vulture flags 100+ OpenAPI spec model fields (Pydantic `BaseModel` attributes like `maxLength`, `exclusiveMinimum`). Skylos recognizes these as schema definitions.
- **httpx** (59 Vulture FP): Vulture flags every transport and auth protocol method. Skylos suppresses interface implementations.

### Where Skylos Still Loses (Honestly)

- **click** (8 vs 6 FP): IO protocol methods (`readable`, `readinto`) on `io.RawIOBase` subclasses — called by Python's IO stack, not by direct call sites.
- **starlette** (4 vs 2 FP): Instance method calls across files (`obj.method()`) not resolved back to class definitions.
- **tqdm** (18 vs 37 FP, 0 vs 1 TP): Skylos misses 1 dead function in `__init__.py` because it suppresses `__init__.py` definitions as potential re-exports.

### Skylos vs. Knip (TypeScript)

We also benchmarked Skylos against [Knip](https://knip.dev) on a real-world TypeScript library:

| | [unjs/consola](https://github.com/unjs/consola) (7k stars, 21 files, ~2,050 LOC) |
|:---|:---|
| **Dead items** | 4 (entire orphaned `src/utils/format.ts` module) |

| Metric | Skylos | Knip |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Recall** | **100%** (4/4) | **100%** (4/4) |
| **Precision** | **36.4%** | 7.5% |
| **F1 Score** | **53.3%** | 14.0% |
| **Speed** | **6.83s** | 11.08s |

Both tools find all dead code. Skylos has **~5x better precision** — Knip incorrectly flags package entry points as dead files (its `package.json` exports point to `dist/` not `src/`) and reports public API re-exports as unused.

> *Reproduce: `cd real_life_examples/consola && python3 ../benchmark_consola.py`*

---

## How It Works

Skylos builds a reference graph of your entire codebase - who defines what, who calls what, across all files.

```
Parse all files -> Build definition map -> Track references -> Find orphans (zero refs = dead)
```

### High Precision & Confidence Scoring
Static analysis often struggles with Python's dynamic nature (e.g., `getattr`, `pytest.fixture`). Skylos minimizes false positives through:

1.  **Confidence Scoring:** Grades findings (High/Medium/Low) so you only see what matters.
2.  **Hybrid Verification:** Uses LLM reasoning to double-check static findings before reporting.
3.  **Runtime Tracing:** Optional `--trace` mode validates "dead" code against actual runtime execution.

| Confidence | Meaning | Action |
|------------|---------|--------|
| 100 | Definitely unused | Safe to delete |
| 60 | Probably unused (default threshold) | Review first |
| 40 | Maybe unused (framework helpers) | Likely false positive |
| 20 | Possibly unused (decorated/routes) | Almost certainly used |
| 0 | Show everything | Debug mode |

```bash
skylos . -c 60  # Default: high-confidence findings only
skylos . -c 30  # Include framework helpers  
skylos . -c 0  # Everything
```

### Framework Detection

When Skylos sees Flask, Django, FastAPI, Next.js, or React imports, it adjusts scoring automatically:

| Pattern | Handling |
|---------|----------|
| `@app.route`, `@router.get` | Entry point → marked as used |
| `app.add_url_rule(...)`, `app.add_api_route(...)`, `app.add_route(...)`, `app.register_listener(...)`, `app.register_middleware(...)` | Imperative route or lifecycle registration → marked as used |
| `@pytest.fixture` | Treated as a pytest entrypoint, but can be reported as unused if never referenced |
| `@pytest.hookimpl`, `@hookimpl` | Plugin hook implementation → marked as used |
| `@celery.task` | Entry point → marked as used |
| `getattr(mod, "func")` | Tracks dynamic reference |
| `getattr(mod, f"handle_{x}")` | Tracks pattern `handle_*` |
| Next.js `page.tsx`, `layout.tsx`, `route.ts` | Default/named exports → marked as used |
| Next.js `getServerSideProps`, `generateMetadata` | Config exports → marked as used |
| `React.memo()`, `forwardRef()` | Wrapped components → marked as used |
| Exported `use*` hooks | Custom hooks → marked as used |

### Test File Exclusion

Tests call code in weird ways that look like dead code. By default, Skylos excludes:

| Detected By | Examples |
|-------------|----------|
| Path | `/tests/`, `/test/`, `*_test.py` |
| Imports | `pytest`, `unittest`, `mock` |
| Decorators | `@pytest.fixture`, `@patch` |

```bash
# These are auto-excluded (confidence set to 0)
/project/tests/test_user.py
/project/test/helper.py  

# These are analyzed normally
/project/user.py
/project/test_data.py  # Doesn't end with _test.py
```

Want test files included? Use `--include-folder tests`.

### Philosophy

> When ambiguous, we'd rather miss dead code than flag live code as dead.

Framework endpoints are called externally (HTTP, signals). Name resolution handles aliases. When things get unclear, we err on the side of caution.

### Precision Regression Guard

Skylos ships a curated corpus of small fixtures that encode framework contracts and important Python runtime patterns we must not regress on.

Run it locally when you change analysis behavior:

```bash
python3 scripts/corpus_ci.py --manifest corpus/manifest.json
```

In GitHub, keep the `Corpus Guard` workflow required in branch protection. When you fix a confirmed false positive, add a focused fixture and expectation to the corpus in the same change.

## Unused Pytest Fixtures

Skylos can detect pytest fixtures that are defined but never used.

```bash
skylos . --pytest-fixtures
```

This includes fixtures inside conftest.py, since conftest.py is the standard place to store shared test fixtures.


## Advanced Workflows

These commands are optional. Use them when you want LLM-assisted review, remediation, or AI defense on top of the core scanner and CI gate.

Skylos uses a **hybrid architecture** that combines static analysis with LLM reasoning:

### Why Hybrid?

| Approach | Recall | Precision | Logic Bugs |
|----------|--------|-----------|------------|
| Static only | Low | High | ❌ |
| LLM only | High | Medium | ✅ |
| **Hybrid** | **Highest** | **High** | ✅ |

Research shows LLMs find vulnerabilities that static analysis misses, while static analysis validates LLM suggestions. However, LLMs are prone to false positives in dead code if they are asked to invent findings from raw source alone.

Skylos now splits agent workflows into a fast review lane and a slower verification lane.

For dead code, Skylos uses a stricter contract:
- static analysis generates the candidate list
- repo facts and graph evidence are gathered around each candidate
- `skylos agent verify` is the dedicated dead-code adjudication pass
- `skylos agent scan --verify-dead-code` adds that slower verifier back into the review pipeline when you explicitly want it
- deterministic suppressors still exist, and in `judge_all` mode they are attached as evidence instead of silently deciding the outcome

Use `--verification-mode production` if you want the cheaper deterministic-first path for `agent verify`.

### Agent Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `skylos agent scan PATH` | Fast hybrid review: static findings plus one-pass LLM security/quality review |
| `skylos agent scan PATH --verify-dead-code` | Same review path, plus the slower dead-code verification pass |
| `skylos agent scan PATH --no-fixes` | Same review pipeline, skip fix suggestions (faster) |
| `skylos agent scan PATH --changed` | Analyze only git-changed files |
| `skylos agent scan PATH --security` | Security-only LLM audit with interactive file selection |
| `skylos agent verify PATH` | Dead-code-only verification pass over static findings |
| `skylos agent verify PATH --fix --pr` | Verify, generate removal patches, create branch and commit |
| `skylos agent remediate PATH` | End-to-end: scan, fix, test, and create PR |
| `skylos agent remediate PATH --standards` | LLM-guided cleanup with built-in standards (or `--standards custom.md`) |
| `skylos agent triage suggest` | Show auto-triage candidates from learned patterns |
| `skylos agent triage dismiss ID` | Dismiss a finding from the queue |

### Provider Configuration

Skylos supports cloud and local LLM providers:

```bash
# Cloud - OpenAI (auto-detected from model name)
skylos agent scan . --model gpt-4.1

# Cloud - Anthropic (auto-detected from model name)
skylos agent scan . --model claude-sonnet-4-20250514

# Local - Ollama
skylos agent scan . \
  --provider openai \
  --base-url http://localhost:11434/v1 \
  --model qwen2.5-coder:7b

# Cheaper dead-code verification path
skylos agent verify . \
  --model claude-sonnet-4-20250514 \
  --verification-mode production
```

**Note**: You can use the `--model` flag to specify the model that you want. We support Gemini, Groq, Anthropic, ChatGPT and Mistral.

### Keys and configuration

Skylos can use API keys from **(1) `skylos key`**, or **(2) environment variables**.

#### Recommended (interactive)
```bash
skylos key
# opens a menu:
# - list keys
# - add key (openai / anthropic / google / groq / mistral / ...)
# - remove key
```

### Environment Variables

Set defaults to avoid repeating flags:

```bash
# API Keys
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."

# Default to local Ollama
export SKYLOS_LLM_PROVIDER=openai
export SKYLOS_LLM_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434/v1
```

### LLM PR Review

`skylos agent scan --changed` analyzes git-changed files, runs static analysis, then uses the LLM for fast file review and code-level fix suggestions. Dead-code verification is optional and not on the critical path by default.

```bash
# Run LLM review and output JSON
skylos agent scan . --changed --model claude-sonnet-4-20250514 --format json -o llm-results.json

# Use with cicd review to post inline comments on PRs
skylos cicd review --input results.json --llm-input llm-results.json
```

The hybrid pipeline runs in stages:
1. **Static analysis** — finds security, quality, and dead code issues
2. **LLM review** — one-pass file or diff review for security, logic, quality, and performance issues static analysis may miss
3. **Optional dead-code verification** — when requested, the LLM judges static dead-code candidates using graph evidence, repo facts, and surrounding context
4. **Code fix generation** — for each reported finding, generates the problematic code snippet and a corrected version

Each PR comment shows the exact vulnerable lines and a drop-in replacement fix.

### What LLM Analysis Detects

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| **Hallucinations** | Calls to functions that don't exist |
| **Logic bugs** | Off-by-one, incorrect conditions, missing edge cases |
| **Business logic** | Auth bypasses, broken access control |
| **Context issues** | Problems requiring understanding of intent |

### Local LLM Setup (Ollama)

```bash
# Install Ollama
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh

# Pull a code model
ollama pull qwen2.5-coder:7b

# Use with Skylos
skylos agent scan ./src \
  --provider openai \
  --base-url http://localhost:11434/v1 \
  --model qwen2.5-coder:7b
```

### Remediation Agent

The remediation agent automates the full fix lifecycle. It scans your project, prioritizes findings, generates fixes via the LLM, validates each fix by running your test suite, and optionally opens a PR.

```bash
# Preview what would be fixed (safe, no changes)
skylos agent remediate . --dry-run

# Fix up to 5 critical/high issues, validate with tests
skylos agent remediate . --max-fixes 5 --severity high

# Full auto: fix, test, create PR
skylos agent remediate . --auto-pr --model gpt-4.1

# Use a custom test command
skylos agent remediate . --test-cmd "pytest test/ -x"
```

**Safety guardrails:**
- Dry run by default — use `--dry-run` to preview without touching files
- Fixes that break tests are automatically reverted
- Low-confidence fixes are skipped
- After applying a fix, Skylos re-scans to confirm the finding is actually gone
- `--auto-pr` always works on a new branch, never touches main
- `--max-fixes` prevents runaway changes (default 10)

### Recommended Models

| Model | Provider | Use Case |
|-------|----------|----------|
| `gpt-4.1` | OpenAI | Best accuracy |
| `claude-sonnet-4-20250514` | Anthropic | Best reasoning |
| `qwen2.5-coder:7b` | Ollama | Fast local analysis |
| `codellama:13b` | Ollama | Better local accuracy |

# CI/CD

Run Skylos in your CI pipeline with quality gates, GitHub annotations, and PR review comments.

## Quick Start (30 seconds)

```bash
# Auto-generate a GitHub Actions workflow
skylos cicd init

# Commit and activate
git add .github/workflows/skylos.yml && git push
```

That's it! Your next PR will have:
- Dead code detection
- Security scanning (SQLi, SSRF, secrets)
- Quality checks
- Inline PR comments with clickable file:line links
- Quality gate that fails builds on critical issues

**Want AI-powered code fixes on PRs?**

```bash
skylos cicd init --llm --model claude-sonnet-4-20250514
```

This adds an LLM step that generates code-level fix suggestions — showing the vulnerable code and the corrected version inline on your PR.

**Optional GitHub Secrets**

For the default `skylos cicd init` workflow, you do not need any Skylos-specific secrets. Add these only if you enable the matching feature in GitHub Actions (**Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions**):

| Secret | When needed | Description |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | If using Claude models | Your Anthropic API key |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | If using GPT models | Your OpenAI API key |
| `SKYLOS_API_KEY` | For Skylos Cloud features | Get from [skylos.dev](https://skylos.dev) |
| `SKYLOS_TOKEN` | If using `--upload` | Upload token from [skylos.dev/dashboard/settings](https://skylos.dev/dashboard/settings) |

`GH_TOKEN` is automatically provided by GitHub Actions — no setup needed for PR comments.

## Release Automation

Skylos uses a single release workflow for automation:

- `.github/workflows/release-please.yml` updates `CHANGELOG.md`, bumps `pyproject.toml`, opens a release PR, creates the GitHub Release when merged, then builds wheel+sdist and publishes to PyPI in the same workflow.
- `.github/workflows/publish.yml` is kept as a manual fallback (`workflow_dispatch`) if you ever need to republish an existing release tag.

### First-time bootstrap (already configured in this repo)

Release Please is bootstrapped with:

- `tools/release/.release-please-manifest.json` set to `4.2.1`
- `tools/release/release-please-config.json` set with `bootstrap-sha` at the commit that prepared `4.2.1` (`a498b27b6902b34e469acfddac1068635aae8122`)

This prevents backfilling old history and starts automated releases from the current baseline.

### Normal release flow

1. Merge conventional commits into `main` (for example: `feat: ...`, `fix: ...`).
2. Release Please opens/updates the release PR.
3. Merge the release PR to `main`.
4. Release Please creates the GitHub release tag (`vX.Y.Z`).
5. In the same workflow run, Skylos builds and publishes to PyPI using `PYPI_TOKEN`.

### Manual build/publish checks

If you need to validate packaging before a release:

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install "build>=1.2.2" "twine>=6.1.0"
python -m build --sdist --wheel --outdir dist
python -m twine check dist/*
```

If you need to manually run the fallback publish workflow, use **Actions -> Build and publish -> Run workflow** and set `ref` to the exact release tag (for example `v4.2.1`). Do not use a branch name.

### PR title types used for release semantics

Skylos validates semantic PR titles via `.github/workflows/pr-title.yml` with these allowed types:

- `feat`
- `fix`
- `docs`
- `refactor`
- `test`
- `chore`
- `perf`
- `style`
- `ci`
- `infra`
- `revert`

For complete release ownership, guardrails, and recovery steps, see [`RELEASE_WORKFLOW.md`](RELEASE_WORKFLOW.md).

## Release Workflow Runbook

Release roles, prerequisites, branch protection guidance, semantic type policy, and incident recovery steps are documented in [`RELEASE_WORKFLOW.md`](RELEASE_WORKFLOW.md).

## Commands (Detailed)

### `skylos cicd init`

Generates a ready-to-use GitHub Actions workflow.

```bash
skylos cicd init
skylos cicd init --triggers pull_request schedule
skylos cicd init --analysis security quality
skylos cicd init --python-version 3.11
skylos cicd init --llm --model gpt-4.1
skylos cicd init --upload                        # include --upload step + SKYLOS_TOKEN env
skylos cicd init --upload --llm --model claude-sonnet-4-20250514  # upload + LLM
skylos cicd init --defend                        # add AI Defense check step
skylos cicd init --defend --upload               # defend + upload results to cloud
skylos cicd init --no-baseline
skylos cicd init -o .github/workflows/security.yml
```

### `skylos cicd gate`

Checks findings against your quality gate. Exits `0` (pass) or `1` (fail). Uses the same `check_gate()` as `skylos . --gate`.

```bash
skylos . --danger --quality --secrets --json > results.json 2>/dev/null
skylos cicd gate --input results.json
skylos cicd gate --input results.json --strict
skylos cicd gate --input results.json --summary
```

You can also use the main CLI directly:

```bash
skylos . --gate --summary
```

Configure thresholds in `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[tool.skylos.gate]
fail_on_critical = true
max_critical = 0
max_high = 5
max_security = 10
max_quality = 10
```

### `skylos cicd annotate`

Emits GitHub Actions annotations (`::error`, `::warning`, `::notice`). Uses the same `_emit_github_annotations()` as `skylos . --github`, with sorting and a 50-annotation cap.

```bash
skylos cicd annotate --input results.json
skylos cicd annotate --input results.json --severity high
skylos cicd annotate --input results.json --max 30

skylos . --github
```

### `skylos cicd review`

Posts inline PR review comments and a summary via `gh` CLI. Only comments on lines changed in the PR.

```bash
skylos cicd review --input results.json
skylos cicd review --input results.json --pr 20
skylos cicd review --input results.json --summary-only
skylos cicd review --input results.json --max-comments 10
skylos cicd review --input results.json --diff-base origin/develop

# With LLM-generated code fixes (vulnerable code → fixed code)
skylos cicd review --input results.json --llm-input llm-results.json
```

When `--llm-input` is provided, each inline comment shows the problematic code and the corrected version:

```
🔴 CRITICAL SKY-D211

Possible SQL injection: tainted or string-built query.

Why: User input is concatenated directly into the SQL query string.

Vulnerable code:
  results = conn.execute(f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE name LIKE '%{q}%'").fetchall()

Fixed code:
  results = conn.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE name LIKE ?", (f"%{q}%",)).fetchall()
```

In GitHub Actions, PR number and repo are auto-detected. Requires `GH_TOKEN`.

## How It Fits Together

The gate and annotation logic lives in the core Skylos modules (`gatekeeper.py` and `cli.py`). The `cicd` commands are convenience wrappers that read from a JSON file and call the same functions:

| `skylos cicd` command | Calls |
|-----------------------|-------|
| `gate` | `gatekeeper.run_gate_interaction(summary=True)` |
| `annotate` | `cli._emit_github_annotations(max_annotations=50)` |
| `review` | New — `cicd/review.py` (PR comments via `gh api`) |
| `init` | New — `cicd/workflow.py` (YAML generation) |

## Tips

- **Run analysis once, consume many times** — use `--json > results.json 2>/dev/null` then pass `--input results.json` to each subcommand.
- **Baseline** — run `skylos baseline .` to snapshot existing findings, then `--baseline` in CI to only flag new issues.
- **Local testing** — all commands work locally. `gate` and `annotate` print to stdout. `review` requires `gh` CLI.

## MCP Server

mcp-name: io.github.duriantaco/skylos

Skylos exposes its analysis capabilities as an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server, allowing AI assistants like Claude Desktop to scan your codebase directly.

### Setup

```bash
pip install skylos
```

Add to your Claude Desktop config (`~/.config/claude/claude_desktop_config.json` on Linux, `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` on macOS):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "skylos": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["-m", "skylos_mcp.server"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Available Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `analyze` | Dead code detection (unused functions, imports, classes, variables) |
| `security_scan` | Security vulnerability scan (`--danger` equivalent) |
| `quality_check` | Code quality and complexity analysis (`--quality` equivalent) |
| `secrets_scan` | Hardcoded secrets detection (`--secrets` equivalent) |
| `remediate` | End-to-end: scan, generate LLM fixes, validate with tests |
| `generate_fix` | Generate removal patches for confirmed dead code |
| `verify_dead_code` | LLM-verify dead code findings (reduce false positives) |
| `learn_triage` | Record a triage decision for pattern learning |
| `get_triage_suggestions` | Get auto-triage candidates from learned patterns |

### Available Resources

| Resource | URI | Description |
|----------|-----|-------------|
| Latest result | `skylos://results/latest` | Most recent analysis run |
| Result by ID | `skylos://results/{run_id}` | Specific analysis run |
| List results | `skylos://results` | All stored analysis runs |

### Usage in Claude Desktop

Once configured, you can ask Claude:

- "Scan my project for security issues" → calls `security_scan`
- "Check code quality in src/" → calls `quality_check`
- "Find hardcoded secrets" → calls `secrets_scan`
- "Fix security issues in my project" → calls `remediate`

## Baseline Tracking

Baseline tracking lets you snapshot existing findings so CI only flags **new** issues introduced by a PR.

```bash
# Create baseline from current state
skylos baseline .

# Run analysis, only show findings NOT in the baseline
skylos . --danger --secrets --quality --baseline

# In CI: compare against baseline
skylos . --danger --baseline --gate
```

The baseline is stored in `.skylos/baseline.json`. Commit this file to your repo so CI can use it.

**[Install from VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=oha.skylos-vscode-extension)**


## Gating

Block bad code before it merges. Configure thresholds, run locally, then automate in CI.

### Initialize Configuration
```bash
skylos init
```

Creates `[tool.skylos]` in your `pyproject.toml`:
```toml
[tool.skylos]
# Quality thresholds
complexity = 10
nesting = 3

### Free Tier

Run scans locally with exit codes:

```bash
skylos . --danger --gate
```

- Exit code `0` = passed
- Exit code `1` = failed

Use in any CI system:

```yaml
name: Skylos Quality Gate

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main, master]

jobs:
  skylos:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: '3.11'
      - run: pip install skylos
      - run: skylos . --danger --gate
```

> **Limitation:** Anyone with repo access can delete or modify this workflow.

---

### Pro Tier

Server-controlled GitHub checks that **cannot be bypassed** by developers.

### Quick Setup

```bash
pip install skylos
skylos sync setup
```

### How It Works

1. Developer opens PR → GitHub App creates required check ("Queued")
2. Scan runs → Results upload to Skylos server
3. Server updates check → Pass ✅ or Fail ❌
4. Developer **cannot merge** until check passes

### Free vs Pro

| Feature | Free | Pro |
|---------|------|-----|
| Local scans | ✅ | ✅ |
| `--gate` exit codes | ✅ | ✅ |
| GitHub Actions | ✅ (DIY) | ✅ (auto) |
| Developer can bypass? | Yes | **No** |
| Server-controlled check | ❌ | ✅ |
| Slack/Discord alerts | ❌ | ✅ |

### GitHub App Setup

1. **Dashboard -> Settings -> Install GitHub App**
2. Select your repository
3. In GitHub repo settings:
   - Settings -> Branches -> Add rule -> `main`
   - Require status checks
   - Select "Skylos Quality Gate"

### Add Token to GitHub

Repo **Settings → Secrets → Actions → New secret**
- Name: `SKYLOS_TOKEN`  
- Value: *(from Dashboard → Settings)*

## Integration and Ecosystem

Skylos is designed to live everywhere your code does—from your IDE to your deployment pipeline.

### 1. Integration Environments

| Environment | Tool | Use Case |
|-------------|------|----------|
| VS Code | Skylos Extension | Real-time guarding. Highlights code rot and risks on-save. |
| Web UI | `skylos run` | Launch a local dashboard for visual auditing. Defaults to `localhost:5090`; override with `--port` or `SKYLOS_PORT`. |
| CI/CD | GitHub Actions / Pre-commit | Automated gates that audit every PR before it merges. |
| Quality Gate | `skylos --gate` | Block deployment if security or complexity thresholds are exceeded. |

### 2. Output Formats

Control how you consume the watchdog's findings.

| Flag | Format | Primary Use |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `--tui` | TUI Dashboard | Launch the interactive TUI dashboard. |
| `--tree` | Logic Tree | Visualizes code hierarchy and structural dependencies. |
| `--json` | Machine Raw | Piping results to `jq`, custom scripts, or log aggregators. |
| `--sarif` | SARIF | GitHub Code Scanning, IDE integration. Includes CWE taxonomy and per-rule CWE relationships |
| `--llm` | LLM Report | Structured findings with code context for Claude Code, Codex, or any AI agent. |
| `-o, --output` | File Export | Save the audit report directly to a file instead of `stdout`. |


## Auditing and Precision

By default, Skylos finds dead code. Enable additional scans with flags.

For dead-code precision regressions, use the checked-in corpus guard:

```bash
python3 scripts/corpus_ci.py --manifest corpus/manifest.json
```

This is a deterministic regression suite built from curated framework and Python-language patterns. It is not a proof of correctness, but it is the main guard against reintroducing known false positives.

### Dead Code (default)

```bash
skylos .
```

**Reading the output:**

| Column | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Name** | The unused function, import, class, or variable |
| **Location** | `file:line` where it's defined |
| **Conf** | Confidence score (0–100%) — how certain Skylos is that this code is truly unused. Higher = safer to remove |

### Security (`--danger`)

Tracks tainted data from user input to dangerous sinks.

```bash
skylos . --danger
```

**Reading the output:**

| Column | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Issue** | The vulnerability type (e.g. SQL injection, eval) with its rule ID |

| **Fix** | The patched version to upgrade to |

### Quality (`--quality`)

Flags functions that are hard to maintain.
```bash
skylos . --quality
```

**Reading the output:**

| Column | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Type** | The category: Complexity, Nesting, Structure, Quality (duplicate literals, coupling, cohesion) |
| **Name** | The function, class, or string literal that triggered the finding |
| **Detail** | The measured value and the threshold — e.g. `Complexity: 14 (max 10)` means 14 branches were found but the limit is 10; `repeated 5× (max 3)` means a string literal appears 5 times but should appear at most 3 |
| **Location** | `file:line` where the finding starts |

| Rule | ID | What It Catches |
|------|-----|-----------------|
| **Complexity** | | |
| Cyclomatic complexity | SKY-Q301 | Too many branches/loops (default: >10) |
| Deep nesting | SKY-Q302 | Too many nested levels (default: >3) |
| Async Blocking | SKY-Q401 | Detects blocking calls inside async functions that kill server throughput |
| God class | SKY-Q501 | Class has too many methods/attributes |
| Coupling (CBO) | SKY-Q701 | High inter-class coupling (7 dependency types: inheritance, type hints, instantiation, attribute access, imports, decorators, protocol/ABC) |
| Cohesion (LCOM) | SKY-Q702 | Low class cohesion — disconnected method groups that should be split (LCOM1/4/5 metrics with Union-Find) |
| **Architecture** | | |
| Distance from Main Sequence | SKY-Q802 | Module far from ideal balance of abstractness vs instability |
| Zone warning | SKY-Q803 | Module in Zone of Pain (rigid) or Zone of Uselessness (throwaway) |
| DIP violation | SKY-Q804 | Stable module depends on unstable module (Dependency Inversion Principle) |
| **Structure** | | |
| Too many arguments | SKY-C303 | Functions with >5 args |
| Function too long | SKY-C304 | Functions >50 lines |
| **Logic** | | |
| Mutable default | SKY-L001 | `def foo(x=[])` - causes state leaks |
| Bare except | SKY-L002 | `except:` swallows SystemExit |
| Dangerous comparison | SKY-L003 | `x == None` instead of `x is None` |
| Anti-pattern try block | SKY-L004 | Nested try, or try wrapping too much logic |
| Unused exception var | SKY-L005 | `except Error as e:` where `e` is never referenced |
| Inconsistent return | SKY-L006 | Function returns both values and `None` |
| Duplicate string literal | SKY-L027 | Same string repeated 3+ times (see [suppressing duplicate strings](#suppressing-duplicate-string-findings)) |
| Too many returns | SKY-L028 | Function has 5+ return statements |
| Boolean trap | SKY-L029 | Boolean positional parameter harms call-site readability |
| **Performance** | | |
| Memory load | SKY-P401 | `.read()` / `.readlines()` loads entire file |
| Pandas no chunk | SKY-P402 | `read_csv()` without `chunksize` |
| Nested loop | SKY-P403 | O(N²) complexity |
| **Unreachable** | | |
| Unreachable Code | SKY-UC001 | `if False:` or `else` after always-true |
| **Empty** | | |
| Empty File | SKY-E002 | Empty File |

To ignore a specific rule:
```toml
# pyproject.toml
[tool.skylos]
ignore = ["SKY-P403"]  # Allow nested loops
```

Tune thresholds and disable rules in `pyproject.toml`:
```toml
[tool.skylos]
# Adjust thresholds
complexity = 15        # Default: 10
nesting = 4            # Default: 3
max_args = 7           # Default: 5
max_lines = 80
```

### Suppressing Duplicate String Findings

Skylos flags string literals that appear 3+ times (rule `SKY-L027`). If a repeated string is intentional (e.g. a status value checked in multiple places), you have three options:

**Option 1: Raise the threshold** — only flag strings repeated more than N times:
```toml
# pyproject.toml
[tool.skylos]
duplicate_strings = 10   # Default: 3. Set to 999 to effectively disable.
```

**Option 2: Disable the rule entirely:**
```toml
# pyproject.toml
[tool.skylos]
ignore = ["SKY-L027"]
```

**Option 3: Suppress inline** — on the specific line:
```python
if somevar == "lokal":  # skylos: ignore
    do_something()
```

### Technical Debt (`skylos debt`)

Ranks structural debt hotspots using the existing static findings from quality, architecture, and dead code analysis.

```bash
skylos debt .
skylos debt . --changed
skylos debt . --baseline
skylos debt . --save-baseline
skylos debt . --history
skylos debt . --json
```

**How the debt output works:**

| Field | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **score** | Structural debt score for the hotspot itself |
| **priority** | Triage priority for what to fix next. Changed files and baseline drift raise this without changing structural debt score |
| **project score** | Repo-level structural debt score. This stays project-scoped even when `--changed` is used |
| **baseline status** | Whether a hotspot is `new`, `worsened`, `improved`, or `unchanged` versus the saved debt baseline |

`--changed` is a filter/view mode, not a different scoring model. It limits the visible hotspot list to git-changed files, but the repo debt score still reflects the full project.

Debt baselines and debt history are project-level artifacts. `--save-baseline` and `--history` only work when you scan the project root.

### Default CLI Options (`addopts`)

Set default flags in `pyproject.toml` so you don't have to type them every time — just like pytest's `addopts`:

```toml
[tool.skylos]
addopts = ["--quality", "--danger", "--secrets"]
```

String format also works:

```toml
[tool.skylos]
addopts = "--quality --danger --confidence=80"
```

CLI flags override `addopts`, so you can always narrow or widen a run without editing config.

Skylos also honors `[tool.skylos].exclude` during CLI scans, which is the cleanest place
to keep team-specific paths like custom venv names or `.claude/worktrees/`.

### Legacy AI Flags

```bash
# LLM-powered audit (single file)
skylos . --audit

# Specify model
skylos . --audit --model claude-haiku-4-5-20251001
```

> **Note:** For full project context and better results, use `skylos agent scan` instead. For auto-fixing, use `skylos agent remediate`.

### Combine Everything
```bash
skylos . -a                           # All static scans (danger + secrets + quality + sca)
skylos agent remediate . --dry-run    # Preview AI-assisted fixes
```

## Smart Tracing

Static analysis can't see everything. Python's dynamic nature means patterns like `getattr()`, plugin registries, and string-based dispatch look like dead code—but they're not.

**Smart tracing solves this.** By running your tests with `sys.settrace()`, Skylos records every function that actually gets called.

### Quick Start
```bash
# Run tests with call tracing, then analyze
skylos . --trace

# Trace data is saved to .skylos_trace
skylos .
```

### How It Works

| Analysis Type | Accuracy | What It Catches |
|---------------|----------|-----------------|
| Static only | 70-85% | Direct calls, imports, decorators |
| + Framework rules | 85-95% | Django/Flask routes, pytest fixtures |
| + `--trace` | 95-99% | Dynamic dispatch, plugins, registries |

### Example
```python
# Static analysis will think this is dead because there's no direct call visible
def handle_login():
    return "Login handler"

# But it is actually called dynamically at runtime
action = request.args.get("action")  
func = getattr(module, f"handle_{action}")
func()  # here  
```

| Without Tracing | With `--trace` |
|-----------------|----------------|
| `handle_login` flagged as dead | `handle_login` marked as used |

### When To Use

| Situation | Command |
|-----------|---------|
| Have pytest/unittest tests | `skylos . --trace` |
| No tests | `skylos .` (static only; repeated runs reuse `.skylos/cache/grep_results.json` for grep verification) |
| CI with cached trace | `skylos .` (reuses `.skylos_trace`) |

### What Tracing Catches

These patterns are invisible to static analysis but caught with `--trace`:
```python

# 1. Dynamic dispatch
func = getattr(module, f"handle_{action}")
func()

# 2. Plugin or registry patterns  
PLUGINS = []
def register(f): 
  PLUGINS.append(f)
return f

@register
def my_plugin(): ...  

# 3. Visitor patterns
class MyVisitor(ast.NodeVisitor):
    def visit_FunctionDef(self, node): ...  # Called via getattr

# 4. String-based access
globals()["my_" + "func"]()
locals()[func_name]()
```

### Important Notes

- **Tracing only adds information.** Low test coverage won't create false positives. It just means some dynamic patterns **may** still be flagged.
- **Commit `.skylos_trace`** to reuse trace data in CI without re-running tests.
- **Tests don't need to pass.** Tracing records what executes, regardless of pass/fail status.

## Filtering

Control what Skylos analyzes and what it ignores.

### Inline Suppression

Silence specific findings with comments:
```python
# Ignore dead code detection on this line
def internal_hook():  # pragma: no skylos
    pass

# this also works
def another():  # pragma: no cover
    pass

def yet_another():  # noqa
    pass
```

### Folder Exclusion

By default, Skylos excludes: `__pycache__`, `.git`, `.pytest_cache`, `.mypy_cache`, `.tox`, `htmlcov`, `.coverage`, `build`, `dist`, `*.egg-info`, `venv`, `.venv`
```bash
# See what's excluded by default
skylos --list-default-excludes

# Add more exclusions
skylos . --exclude-folder vendor --exclude-folder generated

# Skylos also respects project `.gitignore` entries during file discovery
# so ignored folders like custom venvs and worktrees are skipped automatically

# Force include an excluded folder
skylos . --include-folder venv

# Scan everything (no exclusions)
skylos . --no-default-excludes
```

Use `[tool.skylos].exclude` in `pyproject.toml` for team-wide custom exclusions that should apply
even outside `.gitignore`.

### Rule Suppression

Disable rules globally in `pyproject.toml`:
```toml
[tool.skylos]
ignore = [
    "SKY-P403",   # Allow nested loops
    "SKY-L003",   # Allow == None
    "SKY-S101",   # Allow hardcoded secrets (not recommended)
]
```

### Summary

| Want to... | Do this |
|------------|---------|
| Skip one line | `# pragma: no skylos` |
| Skip one secret | `# skylos: ignore[SKY-S101]` |
| Skip a folder | `--exclude-folder NAME` |
| Skip a rule globally | `ignore = ["SKY-XXX"]` in pyproject.toml |
| Include excluded folder | `--include-folder NAME` |
| Skip team-specific folders | `exclude = ["customenv", ".claude/worktrees"]` in pyproject.toml |
| Run all checks | `-a` or `addopts` in pyproject.toml |
| Scan everything | `--no-default-excludes` |

## Whitelist Configuration

Suppress false positives permanently without inline comments cluttering your code.

### CLI Commands
```bash
# Add a pattern
skylos whitelist 'handle_*'

# Add with reason
skylos whitelist dark_logic --reason "Called via globals() in dispatcher"

# View current whitelist
skylos whitelist --show
```

### Inline Ignores
```python
# Single line
def dynamic_handler():  # skylos: ignore
    pass

# Also works
def another():  # noqa: skylos
    pass

# Block ignore
# skylos: ignore-start
def block_one():
    pass
def block_two():
    pass
# skylos: ignore-end
```

### Config File (`pyproject.toml`)
```toml
[tool.skylos.whitelist]
# Glob patterns
names = [
    "handle_*",
    "visit_*",
    "*Plugin",
]

# With reasons (shows in --show output)
[tool.skylos.whitelist.documented]
"dark_logic" = "Called via globals() string manipulation"
"BasePlugin" = "Discovered via __subclasses__()"

# Temporary (warns when expired)
[tool.skylos.whitelist.temporary]
"legacy_handler" = { reason = "Migration - JIRA-123", expires = "2026-03-01" }

# Per-path overrides
[tool.skylos.overrides."src/plugins/*"]
whitelist = ["*Plugin", "*Handler"]
```

### Summary

| Want to... | Do this |
|------------|---------|
| Whitelist one function | `skylos whitelist func_name` |
| Whitelist a pattern | `skylos whitelist 'handle_*'` |
| Document why | `skylos whitelist x --reason "why"` |
| Temporary whitelist | Add to `[tool.skylos.whitelist.temporary]` with `expires` |
| Per-folder rules | Add `[tool.skylos.overrides."path/*"]` |
| View whitelist | `skylos whitelist --show` |
| Inline ignore | `# skylos: ignore` or `# noqa: skylos` |
| Block ignore | `# skylos: ignore-start` ... `# skylos: ignore-end` |

### CLI Output

Skylos displays confidence for each finding:
```
────────────────── Unused Functions ──────────────────
#   Name              Location        Conf
1   handle_secret     app.py:16       70%
2   totally_dead      app.py:50       90%
```

Higher confidence = more certain it's dead code.

### Interactive Mode

The interactive mode lets you select specific functions and imports to remove:

1. **Select items**: Use arrow keys and `spacebar` to select/unselect
2. **Confirm changes**: Review selected items before applying
3. **Auto-cleanup**: Files are automatically updated

## FAQ

**Q: Why doesn't Skylos find 100% of dead code?**
A: Python's dynamic features (getattr, globals, etc.) can't be perfectly analyzed statically. No tool can achieve 100% accuracy. If they say they can, they're lying.

**Q: Are these benchmarks realistic?**
A: They test common scenarios but can't cover every edge case. Use them as a guide, not gospel.

**Q: Why doesn't Skylos detect my unused Flask routes?**
A: Web framework routes are given low confidence (20) because they might be called by external HTTP requests. Use `--confidence 20` to see them. We acknowledge there are current limitations to this approach so use it sparingly.

**Q: What confidence level should I use?**
A: Start with 60 (default) for safe cleanup. Use 30 for framework applications. Use 20 for more comprehensive auditing.

**Q: What does `--trace` do?**
A: It runs `pytest` (or `unittest`) with coverage tracking before analysis. Functions that actually executed are marked as used with 100% confidence, eliminating false positives from dynamic dispatch patterns.

**Q: Do I need 100% test coverage for `--trace` to be useful?**
A: No. However, we **STRONGLY** encourage you to have tests. Any coverage helps. If you have 30% test coverage, that's 30% of your code verified. The other 70% still uses static analysis. Coverage only removes false positives, it never adds them.

**Q: Why are fixtures in `conftest.py` showing up as unused?**
A: `conftest.py` is the standard place for shared fixtures. If a fixture is defined there but never referenced by any test, Skylos will report it as unused. This is normal and safe to review.

**Q: My tests are failing. Can I still use `--trace`?**
A: Yes. Coverage tracks execution, not pass/fail. Even failing tests provide coverage data.

**Q: What do the numbers in the quality table mean?**
A: Each quality finding has a **measured value** and a **threshold** (the configured maximum). For example, `Complexity: 14 (max 10)` means the function has 14 branches but the limit is 10. For duplicate string literals, `repeated 5× (max 3)` means the same string appears 5 times — extract it to a named constant. You can tune thresholds in `pyproject.toml` under `[tool.skylos]`.

**Q: What's the difference between `skylos . --audit` and `skylos agent scan`?**
A: `skylos agent scan` is the fast hybrid review path: static analysis plus one-pass LLM security/quality review, with fix suggestions when enabled. Use `--verify-dead-code` if you also want the slower dead-code adjudication pass. The `--audit` flag on the base command is the legacy static-only mode.

**Q: What does `--verification-mode` do?**
A: It controls how aggressively Skylos sends dead-code candidates to the LLM in verification workflows. `judge_all` is the most aggressive dead-code review mode and is mainly useful for `agent verify` or `agent scan --verify-dead-code`. `production` is cheaper and lets more obvious alive cases get suppressed before the LLM sees them.

**Q: Can I use local LLMs instead of OpenAI/Anthropic?**
A: Yes! Use `--base-url` to point to Ollama, LM Studio, or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint. No API key needed for localhost.

## Limitations and Troubleshooting

### Limitations

- **Dynamic code**: `getattr()`, `globals()`, runtime imports are hard to detect
- **Frameworks**: Django models, Flask, FastAPI routes may appear unused but aren't
- **Test data**: Limited scenarios, your mileage may vary
- **False positives**: Always manually review before deleting code
- **Secrets PoC**: May emit both a provider hit and a generic high-entropy hit for the same token. Supported file types: `.py`, `.pyi`, `.pyw`, `.env`, `.yaml`, `.yml`, `.json`, `.toml`, `.ini`, `.cfg`, `.conf`, `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.js`, `.jsx`, `.go`
- **Quality limitations**: Quality thresholds (`complexity`, `nesting`, `max_args`, `max_lines`, `duplicate_strings`) are configurable in `pyproject.toml` under `[tool.skylos]`.
- **Coverage requires execution**: The `--trace` flag only helps if you have tests or can run your application. Pure static analysis is still available without it.
- **LLM limitations**: AI analysis requires API access (cloud) or local setup (Ollama). Results depend on model quality.

### Troubleshooting

1. **Permission Errors**
   ```
   Error: Permission denied when removing function
   ```
   Check file permissions before running in interactive mode.

2. **Missing Dependencies**
   ```
   Interactive mode requires 'inquirer' package
   ```
   Install with: `pip install skylos[interactive]`

3. **No API Key Found**
   ```bash
   # For cloud providers
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
   export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."
   
   # For local LLMs (no key needed)
   skylos agent scan . --base-url http://localhost:11434/v1 --model codellama
   ```

4. **Local LLM Connection Refused**
   ```bash
   # Verify Ollama is running
   curl http://localhost:11434/v1/models
   
   # Check LM Studio
   curl http://localhost:1234/v1/models
   ```
